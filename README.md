## Meeting European conservation and restoration targets under future land-use demands

The European Union is committed to achieving ambitious area-based conservation and restoration targets in the upcoming decade. Yet, there is a contention that these targets may conflict with societal needs, particularly food and timber production. Ensuring that competing demands for land are met, while the underlying objectives to mitigate climate change and reduce biodiversity loss are achieved, will require strategic planning across land uses, management measures, and jurisdictional boundaries. Here, we use an integrated spatial planning approach to identify restoration and conservation measures that maximize benefits to species as well as contributions to climate mitigation, while ensuring projected 2030 crop, pasture, and forestry production demands are met across the EU.
